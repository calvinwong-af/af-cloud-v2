## What Was Done This Session

### v5.51 — LCL Min Quantity + FCL Min Fields Removal ✅
Removed `min_list_price` / `min_cost` from FCL entirely. Renamed `min_cost` → `min_quantity` on LCL supplier rows. Migration 020 run on local DB. Confirmed on prod — column already renamed (min_cost did not exist on prod DB).

### v5.52 — Terminal Name on Rate Card Display ✅
LEFT JOIN `port_terminals` in FCL + LCL list/detail endpoints. `terminal_name` added to `RateCard` interface. Indigo badge on rate card row when terminal assigned. Resolves MYPKG duplicate visual identity issue.

### v5.53 — Alert Badges Scenarios 1 & 2 ✅ + MCP row highlight fix
Replaced `hasMarginAlert` with `getAlertLevel` returning `AlertLevel` type. Red badge = cost exceeds price, Amber badge = no list price. Full row highlight + `border-l-2` accent added directly via MCP (was cell-only tinting from Opus). Row highlight bug fixed via MCP (expanded state was masking alert background — decoupled bg from border).

### v5.54 — Dashboard Alert Counts + Scenario 3 ✅
Dashboard `ActiveCard` shows alert tray (red/amber/yellow dot lines). Backend: 3 alert count queries added to `dashboard-summary`. `latest_cost_from` / `latest_list_price_from` added to rate card response. Scenario 3 badge: yellow "Price review needed".

### v5.55 — Issues Filter + Dashboard Navigation Links ✅
"Issues only" toggle button on FCL/LCL rate card tabs — bypasses origin requirement, fetches cross-origin alert cards. Backend: `alerts_only` query param with 3-scenario WHERE clause. Dashboard alert tray lines converted to `Link` components navigating to rate card tab with `?alerts=<scenario>` pre-set.

### MCP Direct Fixes
- `_expanded-panel.tsx` — `+ Set List Price` button when no list price rate exists
- `_rate-modal.tsx` — surcharges section hidden for list price modal (`!isListPriceMode`)

## What's Next (Suggested)

- **Pricing module** appears largely complete for core data entry + alerting. Natural next area: **Quotation module** (designed in earlier sessions, implementation not yet started)
- **Geography → Pricing → Quotation workstream** — verify implementation status before starting quotation work
- **Ground transportation design** — separate plan, not yet scoped
