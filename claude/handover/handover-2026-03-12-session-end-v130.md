## What Was Done This Session

### Air Freight UI — Click Handling & List Price Panel Fix (v6.29–v6.30)

**v6.29** — Replaced implicit full-row click zone on O/D header with two explicit buttons:
- Tag icon → toggles list price panel (`expandedODKey`)
- Chevron → toggles airline sub-rows (`expandedGroups`)
- Month cells verified display-only (no onClick)

**MCP patches (between v6.29 and v6.30)** — Attempted to fix stale closure / effect ordering issues with `groupsRef` and `expandedODCardId`. These did not resolve the issue.

**v6.30 (Opus direct fix)** — Full restore + root cause fix across three files:
1. **Root cause:** `isListPriceMode` in `_air-rate-modal.tsx` was checking `initial?.supplier_id === null` but list price rates have no `supplier_id` field (`undefined !== null` → `false`). Modal was showing cost fields instead of list price fields so saves had no visible effect. Fixed to use `isListPrice` prop directly.
2. Restored airline sub-rows with per-airline expand/collapse. Added `expandedAirlineId` / `expandedAirlineDetail` state pair with detail fetch effect.
3. Removed "Reference rate" label from list price row in `_air-expanded-panel.tsx`.
4. Added visual nesting: left border on expanded section, subtle background tint on airline sub-rows.
5. Added DG classification badges on O/D group header row.

### TD-02
- Confirmed complete by Calvin. Marked done. Not a backlog item.
